# RainfallAnalyzer

This Python code collects and analyzes weekly rainfall data for a specified number of weeks. It first prompts the user to input the number of weeks within the range of 1 to 4. Then, for each week, it asks the user to input the amount of rainfall in centimeters. It accumulates the total rainfall over the specified weeks and prints a message if the rainfall for a week is more than 3 centimeters. Finally, it displays the total rainfall recorded for the given number of weeks. The code provides a simple tool to monitor and report on rainfall patterns for a short duration.
